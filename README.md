# Student Information System (Java Project)

## 📌 Overview**

This is an **intermediate-level Java project** that implements a **Student Information System** using **Object-Oriented Programming** and **Data Structures.**
The system allows users to add, view, and search student records using both a **Linked List (Linear Search)** and a **Binary Search Tree (Binary Search).**

## 🚀 Features**

Add new student records (ID, Name, Department, Grade).

View all student records.

Search student by ID using:

* **Linked List** (Linear Search)

* **Binary Search Tree (BST)** (Efficient Search)

Menu-driven console interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used**

Java (Core Java, OOP concepts)

Data Structures: Linked List, Binary Search Tree

Scanner Class for user input

## 📂 Project Structure
<pre> StudentInformationSystem.java
│
├── class Student              // Represents student data
├── class StudentLinkedList    // Stores students using Linked List
├── class StudentBST           // Stores students using Binary Search Tree
└── public class StudentInformationSystem // Main class with menu </pre>

## ▶️ How to Run

1.Clone or download this repository.

2.Compile the code:

<pre>javac StudentInformationSystem.java</pre>


3.Run the program:

<pre>java StudentInformationSystem</pre>

## 📋 Sample Menu

```
===== Student Information System =====
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Search Student by ID (LinkedList)
4. Search Student by ID (BST)
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter Student ID: 101
Enter Student Name: Zia
Enter Department: CST
Enter Grade: 8.9

✅ Employee added successfully!

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Prevent duplicate student IDs.

Add update and delete functionality.

Validate inputs (e.g., grade range).

Save student data to a file (persistence).
