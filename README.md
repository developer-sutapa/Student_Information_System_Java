###Student Information System (Java Project)
**📌 Overview**

This is an *intermediate-level Java project* that implements a Student Information System using Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures.
The system allows users to add, view, and search student records using both a Linked List (Linear Search) and a Binary Search Tree (Binary Search).

**🚀 Features**

Add new student records (ID, Name, Department, Grade).

View all student records.

Search student by ID using:

Linked List (Linear Search)

Binary Search Tree (BST) (Efficient Search)

Menu-driven console interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (Core Java, OOP concepts)

Data Structures: Linked List, Binary Search Tree

Scanner Class for user input
